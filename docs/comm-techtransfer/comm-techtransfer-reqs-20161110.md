#20161110 Labs – Commercialization and Technology Transfer Team Meeting

**Date: November 10, 2016**

**Time: 11:00 a.m. – 11:45 a.m.**

**Agenda:**
 1. Go through slides about the new ESTSC
 2.	Q & A 
 
**Proceedings:**

1.	The goal of the meeting was to introduce the Commercialization and Technology Transfer Team to DOE Code, answer and ask questions, and to get feedback from the team. The first portion of the meeting was spent reviewing slides describing DOE Code, its purpose, and goals. The current product, ESTSC, tracks scientific software and covers three classes: simulation code, code for data analysis, and control codes. It is the centralized software management facility that licenses and distributes scientific software for DOE. The problems with ESTSC are that it misses unreleased codes and does not offer a modern experience. A modern ESTSC would accept that about two-thirds of software is open source and growing quickly, that software is collaboratively developed through various social coding sites and software foundations, and that it is a social activity (i.e. hackathons). DOE Code would not replace sites like GitHub, Bitbucket, and others, but will link to them. Work has been done on changing the name and branding for the new product and is called DOE Code. DOE Code has a strong community backing. There are to be 18 requirements teams with about half of the teams already in place. The DOE Code team has been engaged to the DOE research community already through a few different conferences. Questions to the policy and technical teams are being worked on now, focusing mainly on modernizing the user experience, metadata, and submission processes. The path forward is to continue to gather requirements, engage in the community, and refine the system.

2.	The last portion of the meeting was spent asking and answering questions. First, questions from the team were asked. Topics covered during that time included streamlining the submitting process, the time frame for the soft launch of the product, involving technical staff from labs for testing, and syncing up with OMB and code.gov personnel to ensure no duplicate efforts. 

    Next, questions to the team were asked. Topics covered during that time included pain points with the current product, most time consuming part when making a submission, sections within the current form that have areas that are no longer needed, CDs becoming difficult to deal with and having a save feature when submitting information. It was decided that progress reports would be provided via email, but if enough questions come about, then another conference call will be scheduled.
