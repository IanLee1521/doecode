#20161213 DOE-ASCR Reqs Team Teleconference 

**Date: December 13, 2016**

**Time: 10:00 a.m. – 11:00 a.m.**

**Agenda:**

1.	Go through slides about the new ESTSC
2.	Q & A

**Proceedings:**

1.	The goal of the meeting was to introduce the members of the DOE-ASCR team to DOE Code, answer and ask questions, and to get feedback from the team. The first portion of the meeting was spent reviewing slides describing DOE Code, its purpose, and goals. The current product, ESTSC, tracks scientific software and covers three classes: modeling and simulation code, code for data analysis, and control software. It is the centralized software management facility that licenses and distributes scientific software for DOE. The problems with ESTSC are that it misses most modern DOE software and does not offer a modern experience (still uses CDs and product is a splash page). A modern ESTSC would accept that about two-thirds of software is open source and growing quickly, that software is collaboratively developed through various social coding sites and software foundations, and that it is a social activity (i.e. hackathons, conferences). Work has been done on changing the name and branding for the new product and is called DOE Code. This is something that software developers can recognize. The new product will focus on enabling social coding, integrate researchers with data, publications, and software, create a complete picture by having papers providing the science behind the software, be open source and open to the community, host private repos that are not on GitHub, and have an open web API. DOE Code has a strong community backing with many requirements teams. The team has been on the road, presenting at the TACC workshop, Supercomputing 2016, and will be presenting at SIAM CSE in the spring. Requests so far have included DOIs for software, automating performance security scans, automating provisioning containers, metrics and analytics dashboard, and long-term support for old versions. The path forward is to complete the first round of requirements, refine the product, and to have version one of the product in about 18 months. When that happens, ESTSC splash page will run side by side with DOE Code to ensure a smooth transition. 

2.	The next portion of the meeting was spent asking and answering questions. The first topic discussed was about the loophole concept of a release and how that is being resolved. The definition of a release has led to a “wild west” environment. The goal is to provide a service to incentivize developers to submit their code using the DOE Code service. It will allow people to know that by going through DOE Code, we will handle the communication with tech transfer and they will be able to link papers, data, etc. in one place. By notifying tech transfer and commercialization contacts, lawyers, STI managers, etc. when a researcher creates a new repo, the team hopes to close the gap between what is reported and what exists. 

    Next, the team wanted to know how the linking between research products will work. The publications, tech reports, etc. are already at OSTI. After embargo date is up, then the product is available for download in SciTech. The goal is to link them and automate to the extent possible, but also have a capability for an author to go into their profile and pin papers to their software profile page. 

    The last topic discussed was about legacy codes that already exist and if they will be discoverable without a CD. The DOE Code team has plans to download as many as possible, but that this may be on a case by case basis, paying close attention to legal aspects. The ASCR team suggested that a meeting be set up with other program managers to inform them of the effort, so that they can put it on their researchers’ radar. The team will work on scheduling this meeting. 

**Conclusions/Actions:**

-	Work with ASCR contacts to schedule a meeting with other program managers
