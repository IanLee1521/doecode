#20161202 DOE-GC Teleconference

**Date: December 2, 2016**

**Time: 10:00 a.m. â€“ 10:50 a.m.**

**Proceedings:**

This meeting was with two members from the DOE-GC requirements team. The meeting followed a question/answer discussion style. The first topic was about making sure the laboratories understand the responsibility to disseminate open source software. The team lead then mentioned that we have been in contact with many tech transfer and commercialization contacts from various labs. This led into discussing the workflows and how there will be open communication channels with STI managers, releasing officials, etc. to notify them whenever a researcher has created a DOE Code account or created a repository. The goal is to be more transparent with awarding offices and sites on what is being created and to use this to encourage compliance and attention to copyright. The team members were asked for suggestions for other tech transfer contacts to talk to other than the contacts that have already been engaged, which they provided a couple of new contacts. Team leads asked if they could share the DOE Code blog article that was written with these contacts. 

The next topic was about the software submission process. The researchers want to know how this process will change. The wireframes that have been created will be shared with the team, which do not show specifics or additional options of the submission process but will be helpful to see. One difference is that there will be as much automated as possible. The goal is to pull in as much metadata as possible from a repo if the user provides the repo link. The flow will really depend on what is provided (repo link, if a repo is created, etc.) The submission process will remain similar to the 241.4 with different metadata fields. The form will still ask for the main metadata fields, but the goal is to make it more streamlined, useful, and more modernized. 

The last portion of the meeting was spent getting feedback from the team about certain metadata fields and other questions. Suggestions were made for the Rights/Licenses/Legal Notices/Disclaimers field including collecting the license itself as a standalone piece of metadata and to have a drop down list of known licenses to choose from if open source. For Rights/Legal Notices/Disclaimers it was said that this has value as it will make developers aware/have considerations to think about and also that a freeform field would make sense for this field. There was also a discussion during this time about the potential to distribute old codes that are out of commercialization if the labs are finished with them. The meeting ended with the hope that the next one could be a face to face meeting. 

**Conclusions/Actions:**
-	Send list of Tech Transfer and Commercialization contacts to the team
-	Send wireframes to DOE-GC contacts
-	Send the team a link to the DOE Code blog article to share with Tech Transfer contacts
