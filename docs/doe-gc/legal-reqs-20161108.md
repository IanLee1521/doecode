**Date: November 8, 2016**

**Agenda:**
 1. Go through slides about the new ESTSC
 2.	Q & A
 
**Proceedings:**

1.	The goal of the meeting was to introduce the Legal Requirements Team to DOE Code, answer and ask questions, and gather information about any legal concerns at this time. The first portion of the meeting was spent reviewing slides describing DOE Code, its purpose, and goals. The current product, ESTSC, tracks scientific software and covers three classes: simulation code, code for data analysis, and control codes. It is the centralized software management facility that licenses and distributes scientific software for DOE. The problems with ESTSC are that it misses unreleased codes and does not offer a modern experience. A modern ESTSC would accept that about two-thirds of software is open source and growing quickly, that coding is done collaboratively through various social coding sites and software foundations, and that it is a social activity (i.e. hackathons). Work has been done on changing the name and branding for the new product and is called DOE Code. DOE Code has a strong community backing. There are to be 18 requirements teams with about half of the teams already in place. The DOE Code team has been engaged to the DOE research community already through a few different conferences. Questions to the policy and technical teams are being worked on now, focusing mainly on what the users will want. The path forward is to continue to gather requirements, engage in the community, and refine the system. 

2.	The last portion of the meeting was spent asking and answering questions. First, questions from the legal team were asked. Topics covered during that time included the time frame for the first deployment, running a pilot on a small scale before a large deployment, having an outward facing product so that interested people will be able easily find software and showcase, internal processing for sharing, and easier compliance. 

    Next, questions to the legal team were asked. Topics covered during that time included problematic things about the current ESTSC that have to change, accessibility and ease of use for the new product, improvements that would make everyone’s job easier, legal issues foreseen at this time, security scanning capability, export control, and parallel approvals. The legal team expressed that the more reliable and standardized DOE Code is, the better. It was concluded that another meeting would be scheduled in the next 3-4 months.
