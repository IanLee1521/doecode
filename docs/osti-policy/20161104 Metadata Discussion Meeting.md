#20161104 Metadata Discussion Meeting

**Date: November 4, 2016**

**Time: 10:00 a.m. – 11:05 a.m.**

**Agenda:**
 1.	Work through all metadata fields 
 2.	Discuss next steps
 
**Proceedings:**

1.	The goal of this meeting was to work through the latest list of metadata fields, and by the end, have a draft cut of basic metadata for software submissions. Each field, including three new fields added at the last meeting, was discussed and determined whether to keep, and if so, whether to have the field as mandatory or optional. A few fields were marked in yellow, as these fields needed further questions answered about implementation. Three of these fields, Developer(s)/Creator, Contributing Organizations, and Originating Research Organization(s), are going to be sketched out and pulled to a higher level to get around some of the issues with them. 

2.	The next steps for the metadata fields were discussed. The list of metadata fields will be sent out to various teams (Core team, Stip team, etc.) for their review and feedback. Another step is to dive in deeper into these fields at a lower level and determine more details about each one. A graphical model will also be made of the full metadata schema. The goal is to have version 2 of the metadata software fields to include feedback from other teams and the graphical model. Before the meeting was over, a suggestion was made to go through each field on the updated list, compare them to the DataCite Current fields and mark in the spreadsheet whether DataCite has that field marked as mandatory, optional, or N/A (they do not have it). 

**Conclusions/Actions:**

 - Sketch out model for lines 8, 9, and 10 in the Metadata Software fields list to get around issues
 -	Work through and model the full metadata schema
 -	Compare each metadata field with the DataCite Current fields and mark whether DataCite has that field listed as mandatory, optional, or N/A (doesn’t have it).
