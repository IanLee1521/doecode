#20160930 Policy Meeting
**Date: September 30, 2016**

**Time: 1:30 p.m. - 2:45 p.m.**

**Agenda:**
  1.	Review items on the Metadata software fields spreadsheet
  2.	Discuss some details of the submission process
  
**Proceedings:**
  1.	The purpose of this meeting was to review the metadata software fields spreadsheet and merge the OSTI and DataCite metadata, along with make changes and notes along the way. After changes are made, a second-stage draft would be created for a further detailed review by a few team members. At this time, suggestions/changes were made for specific fields. The ‘Submission Type’ field is to be set to default to software, the ‘Acronym’ field should be requested and not required, the ‘Contributing Organizations/Contributor’ field should be requested and have an auto scan capability, and the ‘Submitting Organization’ field should be the site code. Also, a ‘Mark Open Source’ (yes or no) field needed to be added to the top. If the software is marked not open source, then we need to know the distribution limitation. The ‘DOE Award/Contract Number’ field was suggested to include an auto fill capability if a valid contract award number is entered. 

  2.	While talking about the ‘DOE Award/Contract Number’ field, it brought about some important conversations regarding the submission process. Topics discussed during this time included the creation of a staging/holding area after submission to allow labs or awarding offices a chance for review, requiring submitters to create a DOECode account, how the submission process will affect labs and grantees differently, notifications that will be sent out upon submissions, using the contract number and associative email for identification purposes, and giving the option to labs/awarding offices to let the internal processes at OSTI handle the process if they choose (following the same route as Accepted Manuscripts).

**Conclusions/Actions:**
-	Graphically model the ideal submission process for review
