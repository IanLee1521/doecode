**Agenda:**

1.	Purpose
2.	Creation of models 

**Proceedings:**

1.	The purpose of this meeting was to graphically model an ideal software submission process. 

2.	While having conversations about certain topics, three different models were created. Topics discussed included grant number authentications, conditions if awarding office/lab chooses to see the software submitted, notifications upon submissions, editing in DOECode after submission to E-link, how to designate releases, and web API submissions. The first model created was for submission as a grantee. The second model was for submission as a lab researcher or developer/STI POC for a new single submission. The third model designed was for lab STI POC submission(s) through web API. These cover the three major cases at a high level. The next step is to dive into each box of the model and think about what that activity will look and how that may change based on who the submitter is.  These models will be shared with the policy, technical, and core teams.
