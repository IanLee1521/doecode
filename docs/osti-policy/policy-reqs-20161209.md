#20161209 Policy Meeting

**Date: December 9, 2016**

**Time: 1:30 p.m. â€“ 2:30 p.m.**

**Agenda:**

1.	Latest Updates/Plans for upcoming meetings
2.	Metadata presentation by Katie Knight
3.	Next steps for metadata 

**Proceedings:**

1.	The meeting began with updates. Since the last meeting, version one of the metadata was sent out, and the team received good feedback. After the first of the year, the team will review the feedback and begin creating version two of the metadata. The policy team will also start looking at submission policies and work through the submission models. 

2.	Katie Knight, a Metadata Librarian from ORNL, has been brought into the project to assist with the metadata from an architecture standpoint. In this part of the meeting, she gave a presentation which introduced metadata, defined terms that are commonly used when discussing metadata, showed simple mapping of DOE Code, described and expressed the importance of a metadata application profile, looked at making a data model, and more. Her full presentation can be found [here]( https://github.com/doecode/doecode/blob/master/docs/osti-policy/Metadata_Interoperability_policy.pptx).

3.	The next steps for metadata were discussed. The team should look through the controlled vocabulary and decide if it describes what we are trying to capture with the metadata fields, and to do so in parallel with the feedback received about version one of the metadata. In addition, a metadata application profile should be created out of the version one metadata.

Conclusions/Actions: 

-	Explore controlled vocabulary to see if they match the metadata fields we are trying to capture
-	Create a metadata application profile from version one metadata
